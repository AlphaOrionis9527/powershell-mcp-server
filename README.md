The above return value indicates successful installation.

After configuration, open a new CMD and enter mcp to verify functionality.

The code environment setup is now complete.

## IV. JSON Configuration:
### JSON configuration file content:
Note: Modify the file path accordingly.
Can be used with Claude, cursor, VSCode+Cline, or CherryStudio application.
```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "powershell": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "C:\\Users\\root\\Desktop\\MCP\\powershell.py" (Enter your own path here)
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Open Claude, the tool is now active.

## Summary:
PowerShell can essentially do anything you want with your computer.

Examples:

Generate small reports based on files

What files are on the desktop? Organize XXX files to XXX folder

Operate specific Excel/CSV files to generate professional HTML visualization reports

Lightweight data cleaning

Etc.

Data Visualization Example:
Use specific tables, select a visualization style from the open-source website vchart, copy the code from the right side of the visualization, and have AI mimic this display format using your data to create visualizations.
Principle: Have AI use PowerShell to read Excel and manipulate Excel.

Operations with other documents follow similar principles.

Personally, I find the overall user experience more practical than filesystem-mcp.
I use it on macOS through Windows in Parallels Desktop.
Running in a Windows virtual machine prevents dangerous operations, ensuring the system can be restored within a minute through regular backups.
